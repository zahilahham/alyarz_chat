Dear Member,
 
As you are no doubt aware, world oil prices have reached record levels.  
On the local market, the cost per metric tonne of fuel increased 
from $280 in October 03 to $454 in October 04. It is nearly $600 today.
 
The contribution per Shareholder has been set at $110*. The final settlement date is end August 2005.

Thank you for your understanding in this matter.
