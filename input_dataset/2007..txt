Fellow Shareholders,
Ever since the founding of Alyarz, our overriding priority has been to run the largest private club in the country on the smallest possible budget.
Maintenance Fees at Alyarz are now much lower than clubs with a fraction of our facilities -and running costs.
Successive economic crises have caused a decrease in our income and a sharp rise in our basic costs. This meant we can no longer have the Club we all aspire to on present budget; basic maintenance has suffered - let alone investment in new equipment and services.
Our endeavor to provide a safe, secure, pleasant, environment for us and our children and vitalize our share price means an increase in our yearly fees is today inevitable.
We thank those of you who will meet our new resolve with appreciation and encouragement; we also understand those who will be critical. Alyarz is, in the end, for all of us. 
Looking forward to a blossoming future for us, for Alyarz, and for Lebanon,
I remain, Yours Sincerely
